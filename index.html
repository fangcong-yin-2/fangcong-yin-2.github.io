Hi! My name is Fangcong Yin. I am a senior undergraduate student at Cornell University where I study Information Science, Systems, and Technology. 

I am interested in research in natural language processing and psycholinguistics, specifically in the following topics:

- Controllable text generation with neural models, especially automatic text summarization
- Computational modeling of the cognitive process underlying language production and comprehension
- Interpretable neural models

I have been fortunate to work with Professor Marten van Schijndel and Professor Claire Cardie at Cornell University and Professor Meng Jiang at the University of Notre Dame.
