Hi! My name is Fangcong Yin. I am a third-year PhD student in computer science at New York University advised by Professor  <a href=https://gregdurrett.github.io/> Greg Durrett </a>. I spent two and a half years at the University of Texas at Austin before transferring to NYU. Prior to that, I was an undergraduate student at Cornell University where I studied Information Science. <br>
<br>
I am interested in research in <b> natural language processing </b>, specifically on the following topics: <br>
<br>
- Adaptation of language models via fine-tuning and other techniques  <br>
- Reasoning in language models  <br>
- Interpretability <br>
- Computational modeling of the cognitive process underlying language production and comprehension <br>

<br>
I have been fortunate to work with Professor <a href="https://vansky.github.io/"> Marten van Schijndel</a> and Professor <a href=https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/cardie/> Claire Cardie </a> at Cornell University and Professor <a href="http://www.meng-jiang.com/"> Meng Jiang </a> at the University of Notre Dame.
